Remark:

1.	Unit Test, Coverage Test and git commit log (not include this commit) can found in folder TestResult if need.

2.	This game use Euclidean distance of the distance between monster and end-zone to judge the nearest monster instead of path. 

3.	The stronger monster means more hp after some frames.

4.	Laser Tower upgrade with more power but consume more cost as a drawback.

5.	When running the FxTest for testing, mouse should not click anything. Instead, mouse should only shift to run the demo program.
