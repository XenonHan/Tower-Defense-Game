Remark:

This game use Euclidean distance of the distance between monster and end-zone to judge the nearest monster instead of path.

The stronger monster means more hp after some frames.

Laser Tower upgrade with more power but consume more cost as a drawback.

When running the FxTest for testing, mouse should not click anything. Instead, mouse should only shift to run the demo program.
